## muchutils

A collection of small command line utilities, as a fat binary.


#### count-bytes

`count-bytes` shows the human-scale bytes of an input (e.g. `3.2GB`),
and how well it compresses under a quick compression algorithm


#### sortuniq

[`sortuniq`](src/sortuniq/README.md) provides optimised versions of various `| sort | uniq`
constructions which are common in shell scripting. This construction
finds all the unique lines in an input, regardless of the line order.

---

#### true/false

`true` (returns 0) and `false` (returns 1) are provided for testing.
